# Keepub

Keepub is a **client-side** epub reader built with vue. It complies to a single html page that offers an interface to open and read epub files.

You can try it in this [demo](https://keepub.netlify.app/) (*Nothing is uploaded, everything is handled in your local machine*).

## Features
 - Only requires a modern browser.
 - You can search for word definitions by selecting text.
 - You can also search for selected text with Google.
 - Responsive.
 - Some more generic features (dark mode, text size adjustments).

## Build

Use the following command to build the app.

```bash
npm run build
```

## How it works:

Keepub mainly relies on regular expressions to parse, adjust, and render the content of the epub.

### Note:

This project is still a work in progress, therefore, expect some malfunctions. You can help by reporting any oddities you may encounter while using it.
